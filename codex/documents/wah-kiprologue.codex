    "After years of peace, war found its way to your home-world, delta 1-9. Hoping to avoid violence you decided to leave on one of the refugee ships, unfortunately your fleet was caught in the crossfire before you could make it out of the war zone. In a panic you ran for the nearest docked scout ship, detaching from the mother-ship moments before it was destroyed. Jumping to the furtherest system you could reach without a moments hesitation you made it out just in time, your ship didn't make the jump without taking some damage however. Now it's up to you to get your new vessel up and running again."
