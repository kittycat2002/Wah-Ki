    "The Wah-Ki lived a peaceful life of agriculture and relative isolation for generations, this all changed when an ongoing war between the militant Lynex empire and the Tenibren vigilants made their small home-world a battle ground. Using their knack for adapting the technologies of other cultures, most of the Wah-Ki abandoned their home for a nomadic life in the stars. Well liked by most other races and highly creative, they are a new force in the exploration of space but a powerful one."
