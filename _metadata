  "description" : "An update to the abandoned race mod \"Wah-Ki\"\n\nOriginal mod here http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/wah-ki-spirited-giraffe.2957/\n\n(Props to the AndreasDragon for making the tails look awesome and for just generally being an all around radical bloke \n\nhttp://community.playstarbound.com/members/andreasdragon.530150/ )​\n\nStarbound is an amazing game, but nothing is perfect, and as such they have released update after update without correcting one terrible flaw. Fear not though, I have set out to fix this most heinous oversight! At long last you, yes you, can be an adorably fluffy red panda (er, \"Wah-ki\") traversing the limitless stretches of space! Yes indeed my fellow space cowboys, at long last, all is well in the world.​\n\n(Note: You will need a race selection extender, if you are already using a custom race just fine you are good, if not install \"Xbawks Character Extender\"\n\nIn all seriousness though, this is an early build, it is fully playable but there are a few bells and whistles I have yet to add.\n\n\nAnyways, thanks for checking out my mod, let me know what you think, maybe even rate it if you want.",
